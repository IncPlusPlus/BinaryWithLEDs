# BinaryWithLEDs
## Notice

This program is just a toy I made during some of my spare time. If you have any suggestions please feel free to submit an issue and I'd be happy to look at it when I get a chance. The code is also very rough at the moment and I do plan on making it more presentable.

## Introduction

This program was built and has only been run on an Arduino Uno R3. If you encounter issues with other boards I would be interested in trying to make a compatibility feature. Please submit an issue with your symptoms and I'd be happy to make changes.

The code is very rough and so far this represents a working but unpolished product. I have been testing using different types of smoothing for inputs from a potentiometer and have let the project sit for some time.

#### Make it yourself
To make this project on your own, I will include a guide with pictures on the wiki of this repository in the near future.

## Demonstration

This area is currently a placeholder for whatever media I choose to use here in the future.
